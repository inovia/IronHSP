%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%inst
Initializes Wininet.dll.
When using an instruction that starts with net ~, it must be executed only once at the beginning.
After execution, the result is stored in the system variable stat.
If it is 0, it means that it ended normally, otherwise it means that an error has occurred.

p1
p1: Variable to which the processing result is assigned

%inst
Performs the smallest unit of processing.
It executes time-consuming processes such as waiting for a response from the server and downloading in small units.
In the main program, it is necessary to call the netexec instruction while taking a fine wait time (wait) with the await instruction.

Example:
Loop to wait for results
	repeat
	netexec res
	if res : break
	await 50

^p
After execution, the result is assigned to the variable specified by p1.
If the content is 0, it means that processing is ongoing.
If the content is 1, it means that the process has completed normally.
If the content is negative, it indicates that some kind of error has occurred.
If stat becomes a value other than 0, please process the corresponding processing on the script side as appropriate.

The POST format data is similar to the "&" separated parameters specified in the GET format URL.
However, if you want to send binary data, you need to encode the data into a string.
Since the netrequest_post instruction issues the passed character string as POST data as it is, perform this encoding in advance.

%inst
Set the code conversion of the character string handled by JSON.
JSON data can be retained in any character code by converting the character strings used in the jsongets and jsonputs instructions.
Specify the code conversion parameter by NKF by "option1" and "option2" parameters.
"option1" is used when the character string is acquired by the jsongets instruction, and "option2" is used when the character string is set by the jsonputs instruction.
The optional string is the same as that used by the nkfcnv instruction.
By specifying SJIS input / output in NKF conversion, you can specify the character code handled by HSP as it is.

p2: Variable to which the conversion source string is assigned
"option": NKF conversion option
p3 (-1): Character string size of conversion source
p4 (-1): Maximum output destination buffer size

%inst
Character code conversion is performed by NKF for the character string stored in the variable specified by p2, and the result is assigned to the variable specified by p1.
You can specify NKF conversion options with "option". This allows you to arbitrarily specify the character code to be input and the character code to be output.
If the "option" parameter is omitted, the input code is automatically detected and converted to SJIS.
Below is a list of the main options. (Multiple optional character strings can be specified in succession.) In addition to this, many other specifications are possible. See nkf_doc.txt in the doclib folder for more information.
^p
Setting option contents
--------------------------------------------
    j Convert to JIS
    e Convert to EUC

    J The conversion source is assumed to be JIS (ISO-2022-JP).
    E The conversion source is assumed to be EUC (AT & T).
    S conversion source assumes SJIS
    W Conversion source assumes UTF-8
    W16 conversion source assumes UTF-16 (Little Endian)
    W16B conversion source assumes UTF-16 (Big Endian)
^p
In p3, specify the character string size (number of bytes) of the conversion source. If p3 is omitted or a negative value, the input is automatically calculated as an ansi string in C format.
In p4, specify the output destination buffer size. No conversions beyond this size will be performed. If p4 is omitted or a negative value, the default size (32KB) is used.
The variable specified by p1 is automatically initialized after allocating a string-sized buffer. It is not necessary to initialize with sdim in advance.

Get the result of http request by netrequest_get and netrequest_post instructions.
Be sure to confirm that the download is completed by the reception process using the netexec instruction before acquiring the data.
The operation is similar to the netgetv instruction, but the netgetv instruction gets the text (string), while the netgetv_data instruction gets the binary data in the buffer.
Therefore, it is necessary to reserve the memory buffer required for download as a character string type in advance for the variable specified by p1. (The required size can be obtained with the netgetv_size function.)
After executing the instruction, the data size is assigned to the system variable stat.
