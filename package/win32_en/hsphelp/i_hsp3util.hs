bmppalette
Read bmp image palette information
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
"file name"
"File name": BMP image file name to extract the palette

%inst
Reads the palette information included in the 8-bit format bmp image file and retrieves it as an HSP palette.
Normally, when loading an image in palette mode using the picload command, the palette information attached to the file cannot be loaded.
It can be used when you need palette information in a file, such as the hspdx extension plugin.
Only 8BIT format BMP files can be specified as files.
If any other file or incorrect format is specified, nothing will be done.

text
Set the waiting time for displaying qualified characters
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1
p1 (0): Display wait time (ms)

%inst
Sets the waiting time for characters displayed by the emes instruction.
Specify the waiting time (in milliseconds) for each character with p1.
If you specify a value of 0 or less for p1, it will be displayed all at once without waiting for each character.
The text instruction is treated as an extension instruction using a module instead of the standard from HSP3.
Note that unlike HSP2.x, the waiting time specified by the text instruction is reflected in the emes instruction.

textmode
Set modifier character display
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1,p2
p1 (0): Modifier mode
p2 (0): Adjustment parameters

%inst
Set the modifier characters displayed by the emes command.
Specify the mode with p1. The mode values are as follows.
^p
Mode 0: Normal display
Mode 1: Shadowed display
Mode 2: Contoured display
^p
When modes 1 and 2 are specified, the color set at the time of executing the textmode command is used for shadows and contours.
You can also modify the shadow and contour distances by setting adjustment parameters on p2.
If the adjustment parameter is 0, the minimum distance (1 dot) is set and the distance increases as the value increases.

%index
emes
Show modifier characters
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
"strings"
"strings": Messages or variables to display

%inst
Displays modifier characters.
The emes command displays a character string on the screen in the same way as the mes command, but at that time, the characters can be modified or displayed slowly one character at a time.
You can use the textmode instruction to set modifier characters.
In addition, the display speed of modifier characters can be specified with the text instruction.

gfade
Fade the screen
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1,p2,p3,p4,p5
p1 (0): Fade level (0 to 256)
(p2, p3): Upper left X, Y coordinates to fade
(p4, p5): X, Y size to fade

%inst
Performs a fixed color fade on the specified area for a full-color screen.
This command is for fading in, fading out, etc. by changing the fade level every hour.
Specify the fade level with p1. If it is 0, there is no effect on the screen.
When p1 is 256, it will be completely filled with the specified color.
Specify the upper left X and Y coordinates to fade with (p2, p3). If omitted, it will be (0,0).
Specify the X and Y sizes to fade with (p4, p5). If omitted, the size of the entire screen is used.

statictext
Place static text
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
"strings",p1,p2
"strings": Static text strings
p1 (0): X size
p2 (0): Y size

%inst
Generates static text as a placement object from the current current position.
The placed object ID is assigned to the system variable stat.
You can specify the size of the object to be placed with (p1, p2).
If you want to change the contents of the placed static text, use the statictext_set instruction.
Note that the objprm instruction cannot be used.

statictext_set



%index
statictext_set
Change static text
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1,"strings"
p1 (0): Object ID
"strings": Static text strings

%inst
Change the content of static text placed by the statictext instruction.
You can specify the object ID in p1 and specify the newly set static text string in "strings".

%href

%index
scrollbar
Place scroll bar
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1,p2
p1 (0): X size
p2 (0): Y size

%inst
Generates a scroll bar as a placement object from the current current position.
The placed object ID is assigned to the system variable stat.
You can specify the size of the object to be placed with (p1, p2).
This instruction supports creating a scrollbar as a placement object.
Sending and receiving messages to the placed scroll bar must be performed separately with the sendmsg command.
In that case, a separate document related to the scroll bar message of WIN32API is required.
Also note that the objprm instruction cannot be used for placed objects.

%index
progbar
Place a progress bar
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1,p2
p1 (0): X size
p2 (0): Y size

%inst
Generates a progress bar as a placement object from the current current position.
The placed object ID is assigned to the system variable stat.
You can specify the size of the object to be placed with (p1, p2).
Use the progbar_set and progbar_step instructions to advance the placed progress bar.
Also note that the objprm instruction cannot be used for placed objects.

%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
p1,p2
p1 (0): Object ID
p2 (0): Incremental value

%inst
By specifying the object ID in p1, you can set the step-by-step increment of the progress bar placed by the progbar instruction.
The progress bar has a value from 0 to 100 as a counter by default.
On the other hand, the increment is added step by step.
If you do not specify an increment, the default value is 10.

%inst
By specifying the object ID in p1, the progress bar placed by the progbar instruction is advanced by one step.
The step-by-step increment can be specified with the progbar_set instruction.
