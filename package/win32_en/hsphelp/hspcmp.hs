hsc_ini
Initialization of HSPCMP.DLL
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"filename"
"filename": The name of the file to compile


%inst
Initializes HSPCMP.DLL.
If you want to use the features of HSPCMP.DLL, you need to initialize it first.
The file specified by "filename" is to be compiled.
Specify the file name including the extension (it does not have to be as).




%index
hsc_refname
Specifying the error display file name
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"filename"
"filename": Filename displayed in the error message


%inst
Specifies the source script file name displayed in the error message.
This means that even if you temporarily save the name "test.as" with a different name such as "hsptmp" and compile it, the error message will indicate that there is an error in the "test.as" file. It is for displaying.
If the source script file name does not need to be changed from the file specified in hsc_ini, it does not need to be specified.




%index
hsc_objname
Specifying the output object file name
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"filename"
"filename": Output object file name


%inst
Specify the output object file name.




%index
hsc_compath
Specifying a common directory
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"pathname"
"pathname": common directory path

%inst
Specify the common directory searched by #include.
"pathname" must always be a string ending in "\\".
If hsc_compath is not specified, the "common" directory under the EXE using hspcmp.dll is referenced.




%index
hsc_comp
Object file creation
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
p1,p2,p3
p1 = 0 to (0): Compile configuration options
p2 = 0 to (0): Preprocessor configuration options
p3 = 0 to (0): Whether to display the debug window

%inst
The HSP code compiler compiles the source file to create an object file.
You can specify whether to output debug information to an object file with a parameter of p1.
If p1 is 0 or omitted, the debug information required for displaying error lines is not added to the object file.
If p1 is 1 (bit0), debug information is added.
If p1 is 2 (bit1), only preprocess processing is performed.
When p1 is 4 (bit2), the character string data is converted to UTF-8 code and output.
If p1 is 8 (bit3), the character string data file (strmap) used is output.
If p2 is 0, compile with the "__hsp30__" macro defined.
If p2 is 1, no macro is defined. This is the script editor
It is for passing the "Use HSP extension macro" flag to the compiler.
When the value of p2 is +4 (bit2), the packfile is created based on the instructions (#pack, #epack, #packopt) for automatic creation of the executable file included in the source.
If p3 is non-zero, embed a flag in the object file to show the debug window.
In order to execute the hsc_comp instruction, it is necessary to initialize and specify the file with the hsc_ini instruction.
Also, if necessary, specify the object file name output by hsc_objname. (By default, the output file name will be the file name specified by hdc_ini with the extension ".ax")
If necessary, execute the hsc_refname instruction in advance. As a compilation procedure,
^p
1. "hsc_ini"
2. "hsc_refname" (optional)
3. "hsc_objname" (optional)
4. "hsc_comp"
^p
It looks like.

Returns the version information of the HSP code compiler as a character string in the system variable refstr.




%index
hsc_bye

This instruction is executed automatically and is not normally used.




%index
pack_ini
Initialization of PACKFILE manager
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"filename"
"filename": Operation target file name
%inst
Initializes the PACKFILE manager.
When performing a PACKFILE operation (instruction starting with "pack_"), it is necessary to initialize it first.
The target of the operation is the file specified by "filename".
Specify a file name without an extension.




%index
pack_view
Display the contents list of PACKFILE
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%inst
The content list is displayed with the file specified by pack_ini as a DPM file. Get the result of pack_view with the hsc_getmes instruction.




%index
pack_make
Create DPM file
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
p1,p2
p1: Creation mode (0 = for standard EXE file / 1 = for external DPM file)
p2: Encryption key (0 = use standard key / others = encryption key)
%inst
Creates a DPM file with the file name specified in pack_ini.
In p1, you need to specify whether it is a standard EXE file or a DPM file for external reading.
Also, when creating a DPM file, you can set the encryption key with p2.
If you specify 0 for p2, a standard encrypted DPM file (2.61 compatible) is created.
If you specify a value other than 0 for p2, encryption using that value as the key is performed.
In this case, please note that if the key with the same value is not specified by the chdpm instruction on the script side when reading DPM, it will not be decrypted as a correct file.
The file to be included in the DPM file is the file specified by the text in "PACKFILE" in the current directory.

^p
The operation switch can select the function at the same time by adding.
Specify 0 if no special operation is required.

It is necessary to initialize the PACKFILE manager by pack_ini in advance.
For "path", specify the full path where the HSP runtime library is located.
Create an executable file according to the packfile options.
When 1 is specified for sw, resource rewriting such as icons is executed by the iconins tool.
