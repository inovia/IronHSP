#define
Register a new macro
%group
Preprocessor instructions
%prm
Macro name Macro definition
%inst
Registers with the preprocessor so that the keyword specified by the macro name can be replaced with the specified definition.
The #define macro is used only when an individual wants to write a script easily and customize it, and is not suitable for beginners. The features described here are also infrequently used and should only be referred to when needed.
The #define macro basically registers a replacement string.
^p
Example:
	#define hyouji mes
	hyouji "AAAAA..."
Å´ (after deployment)
	mes "AAAAA..."
^p
By inserting "global" immediately after the #define instruction, you can create a macro that can be used permanently in all modules.
^p
Example:
	#module
	#define global test 0x1234
	#global
a = test; 0x1234 is assigned to a
^p
Normally, if you define #define in a module, the same name will not be recognized in other modules and global areas.
By entering the global specification, you can replace the name defined everywhere after that with a macro.
^
In addition to simple replacement macros, expansion with arguments is possible.
The argument is specified by the argument name of% 1,% 2,% 3 ... enclosed in parentheses after the macro name.
Su.
The argument must be specified as "% numerical value", and the numerical value should be described in order from 1. Note that you cannot specify it by symbol name like the C or C ++ preprocessor.
^p
Example:
	#define hyouji(%1) mes "prm="+%1
	hyouji "AAAAA..."
Å´ (after deployment)
	mes "prm="+"AAAAA..."
^p
You can also set the initial (default) value for the argument.
^p
Example:
	#define hyouji(%1="PRM=",%2=123) mes %1+%2
	hyouji "AAA",a
	hyouji "BBB"
	hyouji ,b
Å´ (after deployment)
	mes "AAA"+a
	mes "BBB"+123
	mes "PRM="+b
^p
The initial (default) value is a value that is automatically completed if omitted when using a macro. If the initial value is omitted, it will not be completed.
When specifying macro arguments, the side specified by #define is enclosed in parentheses, but when actually using it, specify it without parentheses.
^p
	#define hyouji(%1) mes "prm="+%1
	hyouji("AAAAA...")
^p
Please note that a description like this will result in an error.
However, the following parenthesized description is possible by using the ctype option.
^p
	#define ctype kansu(%1) %1*5+1
	a=kansu(5)
^p
This option is effective when you want to use a macro other than the instruction part such as a calculation formula. At first glance, it behaves like a function in C language, but please note that the range of application is narrow because it is actually replaced by a macro.
This description method is different from the original HSP grammar, so we do not recommend using it for anything other than customization purposes where you want to write in your own style.
^
It is possible to set keywords that perform special actions when expanding macros.
This special keyword is mainly for sharing parameters between different macros and for realizing nested structures by stacking.
^p
	#define start(%1) %tstart %s1 mes "START"
	#define owari %tstart mes %o
^p
The "% s1" and "% o" specified here are special expansion macros.
A sample using this will be expanded as follows.
^p
	start "OK" -> mes "START"
	owari -> mes "OK"
^p
In this way, it is possible to share data between different macros.
The special expansion macro has the following types and functions.
^p
   Macro: Function
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
     % t: Set the tag name
     % n: Generate a unique label name
     % i: Generate a unique label name and put it on the stack
     % o: Extract the string on the stack
     % p: Extract the character string on the stack (maintain the stack)
     % s: Stack argument parameters
     % c: Start a new line
^p
The special expansion macro is expressed by "%" followed by one alphabetic character + parameter.
Please put a half-width space after the special expansion macro to distinguish it from the following keywords. Up to the part including spaces such as "% tabc aaa" is judged as a special expansion macro.
The special expansion macro has a general stack (First In Last Out).
This stack can be shared by macros with the same tag name.
Specify the tag name using up to 16 single-byte alphabetic characters after "% t", such as "% t tag name". In the previous example, "start" specified as "% tstart" corresponds to the tag name.
"% S" is a special expansion macro for stacking argument parameters.
If "% s1" is specified, the parameter of "% 1" is pushed on the stack.
Use "% o" to get the string on the stack.
"% O" takes out the character string on the stack and expands it. Since it is a stack, the last one stacked is taken out first.
If you specify "% o0", the stack is ejected, but the string is not expanded (stack eject only).
"% P" retrieves only the contents without returning the stack. "% P0" expands the contents of the next stacked stack. "% P1" takes out another deeper stack. After that, it is possible to specify from "% p0" to "% p9".
An example of label generation is shown below.
^p
	#define start %tstart *%i
	#define owari %tstart await 20:stick a:if a=0  :  goto
*%o
^p
A sample using this will be expanded as follows.
^p
	start -> *_start_0000
	owari -> await 20:stick a:if a=0 : goto *_start_0000
^p
"% I" creates a unique label name that does not overlap with others and stacks it on the stack. If "% i0" is specified, the label name will be pushed one step on the stack, but it will not be expanded.
Also, "% n" only generates and expands a unique label name, not on the stack.
In the above example, a new label is created by label name generation to realize a loop structure. Using this method, you can build a loop structure in which label names do not overlap even if they are nested.
Also, macros (tag names) that did not get all the stacks in one source script file will report an error at compile time.
Be sure to configure the macro instructions so that the entire stack is ejected and finished.
^
The standard definition macros while ~ wend, do ~ until, and for ~ next added in HSP ver2.6 are created by special expansion macros.
^
In special situations, it is possible to expand with a line break by "% c".
The line is split and expanded at the "% c" part. It can be used mainly for defining macros that are expanded to multiple preprocess statements.
However, not all preprocessors currently support macro expansion. If you use it too much, it may be difficult to see, so please understand it carefully before using it.
^p
Example:
	#define def(%1,%2) #deffunc %1@ %c mes@hsp %2@
	def test,a
	return
	def test2,a
	return

#func
External DLL call instruction registration
%group
Preprocessor instructions
%prm
New name "function name" type name 1,Åc

%inst
Register a new instruction to call the external DLL.
You must first specify the external DLL name with the #uselib instruction.
Write the new name, function name, and type separated by a space.
By putting "global" just before the new name, you can create an instruction that can be used permanently in all modules.
^
You can write the full export name of the DLL by enclosing the function name in double quotes, such as "function name".
If it is not enclosed in double quotes, it will be converted to the name "_function name @ 16" based on the VC ++ export convention.
^
Describe the details of the argument in the type name.
As with the #deffunc instruction, specify the argument types separated by ",".
There is no limit to the number of arguments or the order of the types.
The character strings that can be used as the argument type are as follows.
^p
     Type: Contents
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
    int: Integer value (32bit)
    var: Variable data pointer (32bit)
    str: String pointer (32bit)
    wstr: unicode string pointer (32bit)
    sptr: Pointer Integer value or string pointer (32bit)
    wptr: Pointer Integer value or unicode string pointer (32bit)
    double: real number (64bit)
    float: real number (32bit)
    pval: Pointer of PVal structure (32bit)
    comobj: COMOBJ type variable data pointer (32bit)
(*) bmscr: Pointer of BMSCR structure (32bit)
(*) prefstr: Pointer of system variable refstr (32bit)
(*) pexinfo: Pointer of EXINFO structure (32bit)
(*) nullptr: null pointer (32bit)
^p
Items marked with (*) indicate parameters that are automatically passed without having to be specified as arguments.
The following is an example of executing by specifying four arguments.
^p
Example:
	#uselib "test.dll"
	#func test "_func@16" var,int,int,int
test a, 1,2,3; func (& a, 1,2,3) in test.dll is called
^p
If you specify a numerical value for the type, arguments compatible with the DLL type specification of ver2.5 or later are automatically set. However, there are some incompatible specifications. In that case, it will be reported as an error at compile time.
^
It is necessary to pay attention to compatibility with ver2.5 in the following points.
^p
-The BMSCR structure can only refer to the fields from flag to color.
-The PVal structure is compatible with the ver2.5 PVAL2 structure.
-The flag field (type type value) and len field (array information) of the PVal structure cannot be rewritten on the DLL side.
-The string type array variable cannot be accessed from the PVal structure.
^p
In other respects, the same information as HSP ver2.5 will be passed.
^
You can register it as an end call function by putting "onexit" before the function name.
^p
Example:
	#func test onexit "_func@16" str,int,int
^p
In the above example, "_func @ 16" is automatically called when the application is closed.

New name "function name" type name 1,Åc

%inst
Register a new function to call the external DLL.
You must first specify the external DLL name with the #uselib instruction.
Write the new name, function name, and type separated by a space.
By putting "global" just before the new name, you can create an instruction that can be used permanently in all modules.

You can write the full export name of the DLL by enclosing the function name in double quotes, such as "function name".
If it is not enclosed in double quotes, it will be converted to the name "_function name @ 16" based on the VC ++ export convention.
^
Describe the details of the argument in the type name.
You can use the same argument parameters as the #func instruction.
See the #func reference for more information.
The new name registered by the #cfunc instruction can be described in the expression as a function.
^p
Example:
	#uselib "test.dll"
	#cfunc test "_func@16" var,int,int,int
res = test (a,1,2,3); func (& a,1,2,3) in test.dll is called
^p
As the return value of the registered function, the integer value (32bit int) acquired as a result of the external call is returned as it is.
For HSP2.5 compatible calls, the value returned in the system variable stat is the return value of the function.

Module name Variable name 1,Åc
Module name: New module name
Variable name: Module variable name to be registered

%inst
Allocate the section after #module as a module to another space.
Variables and labels inside the module are independent of those outside the module.
^
"Module name" is a name that can be given when dividing multiple modules by name, and those with the same module name share a variable name or label name.
Variable names and label names are treated as completely different among those with different module names.
^
If you omit the "module name", the name "m number" is automatically assigned.
^
Modules must always start with "#module" and end with "#global". By specifying the module section in this way, it is possible to make the space independent of others.
The module name can be up to 18 characters in length and cannot be duplicated with other keywords such as variable names.
Also, be sure to specify a string that does not contain spaces or symbols. (The character types that can be used in the module name are alphabets from a to z, numbers from 0 to 9, and the "_" symbol. They are equivalent to character strings that can be used as variables.)
^
The module variable name registers the local variable associated with the module. The registered module variable name can be used in the processing routine defined by #modfunc or #modcfunc.

%group
Preprocessor instructions
%prm
p1 p2 p3,Åc
p1: Name of the assigned instruction
p2 p3 ~: Parameter type name / alias name

%inst
Register a new instruction by the user.
Specify the name of the new instruction in p1 and the call parameter type after p2.
The name defined by the #deffunc instruction can be used as an instruction in the script.
^
The new instruction will be executed after the line specified by #deffunc.
Execution is performed as a subroutine jump like the gosub instruction, and the return instruction returns to the original execution position.
^p
Example:
	#deffunc test int a
mes "parameter =" + a
	return
^p
The new instruction added will be able to receive parameters.
You can specify the parameter type and alias name for each parameter. The parameter types you specify include:
^p
   int: integer value
   var: variable (no array)
   array: Variable (with array)
   str: string
   double: real number
   label: label
   local: local variable
^p
The alias name indicates the contents of the passed parameter and can be used in much the same way as a variable.
Care must be taken when using var and array properly, and the local type, which indicates a local variable, has a special purpose.
For more information, see the module entry in the programming manual (hspprog.htm).

As a special use, you can register it as a cleanup instruction by writing "onexit" instead of the parameter type. The cleanup instruction is automatically called at the end of HSP script execution.
^p
Example:
#deffunc name onexit
^p
It can be used to clean up the system and release memory when the function is expanded by a module.
^
The name of the new instruction is usually shared in all module spaces and global spaces.
However, if the name is specified after the local specification, it will be treated as module-specific.
^p
Example:
	#module user
	#deffunc local test int a
mes "parameter =" + a
	return
	#global
	test@user 5
^p
This can be used, for example, to define instructions that are used only within the module.
The name registered by specifying local must be called in the format of "name @ module name".

Register a new function by the user.
Specify the name of the new function in p1 and the call parameter type after p2.
The name defined by the #defcfunc instruction can be used as a function in the script.
^
The new function will be executed after the line specified by #defcfunc. Execution is performed as a subroutine jump like the gosub instruction, and the return instruction returns to the original execution position.
At that time, it is necessary to specify the parameter of the return value in the return instruction.
^p
Example:
	#defcfunc half int a
	return a/2
^p
The new function added will be able to receive parameters.
You can specify the parameter type and alias name for each parameter. The parameter types you specify include:
^p
   int: integer value
   var: variable (no array)
   array: Variable (with array)
   str: string
   double: real number

In the executable file automatic creation (ctrl + F9), specify the file to be added to packfile. The specified file is packed together as a resource when the executable file is created. #pack packs in the normal format. If you want to encrypt and pack, please use #epack.
If you try to add a duplicate file, it will be ignored.
"Start.ax" does not need to be specified as an additional file because it is automatically added when the executable file is automatically created.
^p
Example:
	#pack "a.txt"
^p
In the above example, we will pack a file called "a.txt" with the executable file.
You can still create an executable file by selecting the file to be packed from "Edit packfile".

  lang | language code settings | none
  upx | UPX compression settings | None
 ------------------------------------------------------
^p
The following example creates a screensaver called "test.scr" using a runtime called "hsp2c.hrt".
^p
Example:
	#packopt type 2
	#packopt name "test"
	#packopt runtime "hsp2c.hrt"
^p
When "Automatic executable file is created", an executable file is generated based on the information of #pack, #epack, #packopt described in the script being edited.
At that time, "start.ax" is added encrypted by default.
The runtime file (with the extension hrt) specified by "#packopt runtime" runtime file name "" is used in the same directory as hspcmp.dll or in the runtime directory.
The keywords icon, version, manifest, lang, upx are set using the iconins tool after the executable file is generated.
For the icon file, you need to specify a .ico format file.
^p
Example:
// Specify the icon file to embed
	#packopt icon "test.ico"
// Specify the file that describes the version information to be embedded
	#packopt version "test.txt"
// Set "1" when compressing using UPX
	#packopt upx "1"
// Specify language Default is Japanese (1041) Decimal number
	#packopt lang "1041"
^p
If you want to use UPX compression, you need to download upx.exe (Win32 console version) in advance and place it in the same folder as the iconins tool.

#const
Macro name constant definition
%group
Preprocessor instructions
%prm
Macro name constant expression
%inst
Replaces with the specified macro name and sets the numerical value.
Similar to #define, but #const replaces the result of pre-calculation when replacing a constant (numerical value).
^p
Example:
	#const KAZU 100+50
	a=KAZU
Å´ (after deployment)
	a=150
^p
If the value to be used in the source is decided in advance, it is effective for speeding up the source. It is also possible to include macros that have already been defined, so
^p
Example:
	#const ALL 50
	#const KAZU 100*ALL
	a=KAZU
Å´ (after deployment)
	a=5000
^p
Can be used like.
Integers and real numbers can be used in the calculation formula.
You can use the same operator and number description styles as you would for a regular expression. You can also specify the ranking in parentheses.
^
By putting "global" immediately after the #const instruction, you can create a macro that can be used permanently in all modules.
^p
Example:
	#module
	#const global test 1234
	#global
a = test; 1234 is assigned to a
^p
Normally, if you define #const within a module, other modules and global areas will not recognize the same name.
By entering the global specification, you can replace the name defined everywhere after that with a macro.
^
By inserting "double" immediately after the #const instruction, the defined number is forcibly recognized as a real number.
If you do not specify this, an integer and a real number are automatically determined depending on whether there is a value after the decimal point.

%inst
Specifies compile ON / OFF.
If the specified number is 0, #if turns off the subsequent compilation output and ignores the compilation result (it is not executed as a program).
If the value is other than 0, the output will be ON.
This compile control targets the period until #endif appears.
#if, #ifdef, or #ifndef must have #endif in pairs.
^p
Example:
	#if 0
mes "ABC"; This part is ignored
a = 111; This part is ignored
mes "DEF"; This part is ignored
	#endif
^p
You can also use an expression to specify #if, so
^p
Example:
	#define VER 5
	#if VER<3
mes "ABC"; This part is ignored
a = 111; This part is ignored
mes "DEF"; This part is ignored
	#endif
^p
You can also use it like this. The description of the calculation formula and the notes on the operator are the same as the #const instruction.
You can also nest #if to #endif blocks.
^p
Example:
	#ifdef SW
		#ifdef SW2
mes "AAA"; if SW and SW2 are defined
		#else
mes "BBB"; If SW is defined
		#endif
	#endif
^p
Basically, it can be used like a C or C ++ preprocessor.
The preprocessor is automatically applied during normal compilation.

"Initialization function name", "DLL file name", variable type extension number
"Initialization function name": Export name of the plugin initialization function
"DLL file name": DLL name of the plugin initialization function
Number of variable type extensions (0): Number of variable types extended by the plugin

%inst
Register the HSP extension plug-in.
The initialization function name must specify exactly the name exported from the DLL. When exporting from VC ++, "_" is added at the beginning and "@ 4" is added at the end, so describe the name including it. (For DLLs created with compilers other than VC ++, the export name rules are different. For details, refer to the documentation for each environment.)
For example, if you want to register a function called "hsp3cmdinit" in "hpi3sample.dll",
^p
Example:
	#regcmd "_hsp3cmdinit@4","hpi3sample.dll"
^p
It looks like.
When extending a variable type with a plug-in, it is necessary to specify "Variable type extension number".
To add one type of variable type, specify 1 for the number of variable type extensions. If you do not want to extend the variable type, omit the number of variable type extensions or specify 0. Note that if the variable type extension is not specified correctly, the type registration will be invalid.
^
If you specify an integer for the first parameter, the type value to be executed as an internal command is assigned to the keywords defined in the subsequent #cmd.
The type value is a unique value used inside HSP3. Normally, you do not need to use this feature. Also, if you specify "*" instead of an integer, an empty type value is automatically assigned.

Example:
	#cmd newcmd $000

Interface name "interface IID" "class IID"
Interface name: Keywords that identify the interface
"Interface IID": IID string indicating the COM interface
"Class IID": IID string indicating the class of COM

%inst
Define the external component (COM).
Assign class IID and interface IID to the specified interface name to make it available.
IID can be specified with a string ({~}) similar to the registry.
Also, "class IID" can be omitted.
^p
Example:
	#define CLSID_ShellLink "{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"

Preprocessor instructions
%prm

%inst
Register a new instruction to call the external component (COM).
#comfunc registers to call the interface method specified by the #usecom instruction as an instruction.
After that, you can call the component by combining the instruction specified by the new name and the variable of COM object type.
^
Write the new name, index, and type separated by a space.
By putting "global" just before the new name, you can create an instruction that can be used permanently in all modules.
^
Describe the details of the argument in the type name.
As with the #deffunc instruction, specify the argument types separated by ",".
There is no limit to the number of arguments or the order of the types.
The character strings that can be used as the argument type are as follows.
^p
   Type: Contents
 -------------------------------------------------------------
   int: Integer value (32bit)
   var: Variable data pointer (32bit)
   str: String pointer (32bit)
   wstr: unicode string pointer (32bit)
   double: real number (64bit)
   float: real number (32bit)
   pval: Pointer of PVal structure (32bit)
   bmscr: (*) Pointer of BMSCR structure (32bit)
   hwnd: (*) Handle of currently selected window (HWND)
   hdc: (*) Device context of the currently selected window (HDC)
   hinst: (*) Running HSP instance handle
^p
Items marked with (*) indicate parameters that are automatically passed without having to be specified as arguments.
^p
Example:
; Class ID of shell link object
	#define CLSID_ShellLink "{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"
Interface ID of the IShellLink interface
	#define IID_IShellLinkA "{000214EE-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"

	#usecom IShellLinkA IID_IShellLinkA CLSID_ShellLink
	#comfunc IShellLink_SetPath 20 str

	newcom slink, IShellLinkA
	IShellLink_SetPath slink, "c:\\hsp261\\hsp2.exe"
^p
In the above example, IShellLink_SetPath of the IShellLinkA interface is called with a variable called slink.
Note that the instruction registered with #comfunc will always have the first argument as a COM object type variable with the same interface.

#enum
List macro name constants
%group
Preprocessor instructions
%prm
Macro name = p1
Macro name: Macro name to which a constant is assigned
p1: Allotted constant
%inst
Assigns consecutive values to the specified macro name.
Similar to the #const instruction, you can define a macro name that indicates a constant.
^p
Example:
#enum KAZU_A = 0; KAZU_A becomes 0
#enum KAZU_B; KAZU_B becomes 1
#enum KAZU_C; KAZU_C becomes 2
	a=KAZU_B
Å´ (after deployment)
	a=1
^p
The constant is initialized by writing "= (equal)" and a numerical value (or expression) after the macro name. After that, the number will increase by 1 each time it is defined with the #enum instruction.
Use the #enum instruction when you want to define consecutive values by macro.
The #const command eliminates the need to specify a number one by one, making it easy to add or delete later.
