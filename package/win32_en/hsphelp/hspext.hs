Any window capture
%group
OS system control instructions
%prm
"window name",p1
"window name": The title name of the window to get
p1 = 0 to (0): Start ID

%inst
Captures the specified window and prepares to send a message.
^
Search for a window by specifying the string displayed in the window title for "window name".
"window name" can omit the ending string.
For example, a window named "HSP Script Editor" will match either "HSP" alone or the string "HSP Screen".
However, if there is a title with the same name, it is unclear which window will match.
^
You can determine the search ID to start the search by specifying the start ID with p1.
This search ID is the ID number of all windows (and tasks), numbered starting from 0.
You can capture a window with a search ID of p1 by writing "aplsel" ", p1".
^
If the aplsel instruction is executed and the window is successfully retrieved, the system variable stat is assigned 0 and the system variable refstr is assigned the exact window title name.
If the window search fails, the system variable stat is assigned 1 and the message cannot be sent.

%inst
Captures the objects (controls) that belong to the window captured by the aplsel instruction and prepares to send a message.
^
Search for an object by specifying the class name of the object (control) in "object name".
^
In p1, you can determine the search object ID to start the search by specifying the start ID. This ID is priced starting from 0.
You can capture the object ID by writing "aplsel" ", p1".
^
If the aplobj instruction is executed and the object is successfully retrieved, the system variable stat is assigned 0 and the system variable refstr is assigned the exact object class name.
If the window search fails, the system variable stat is assigned 1 and the message cannot be sent.

The character strings specified by "strings" are sent to the target object as keyboard input data.
^
The aplstr instruction can send the character string as it is, but it cannot send the information of special keys such as the [ALT] key.
The aplstr instruction only queues key information.
You need to put a wait or await instruction after it to reflect the result of the actual press.
Sending too much information at one time can overwhelm the queue and prevent it from being sent successfully.
The aplstr instruction is not recognized by all applications. If you do not accept the transmission of the aplstr instruction, try using the aplkey instruction.

Unlike the aplkey instruction, the aplkeyd instruction sends only the information that the key was pressed.
Use it when you want to keep pressing a key or when you want to create a state where multiple keys are pressed at that time.
Also, after sending the information that the key was pressed with the aplkeyd command, the information that the key was released must be sent with the aplkeyu command. The aplkeyd instruction only queues key information.
In order to reflect the result of the actual press, it is necessary to insert a wait or await instruction immediately after.
If you specify 0 for p1, only the special key code information is sent.

Initialize serial port
%group
Communication control command
%prm
p1,"protocol"
p1 = 0 to (0): COM port number
"protocol": Protocol specification string

%inst
Initializes the serial port so that it can send and receive.
^
To use the serial communication instruction set, you must first initialize the port with the comopen instruction.
Use p1 to specify the COM port number. If it is 1, COM1 corresponds, if it is 2, COM2Åc corresponds. If p1 is 0, the printer (parallel) port is specified instead of serial.
You can write a protocol specification string with "protocol".
The protocol specification character string must be described as follows.
^
"baud=1200 parity=N data=8 stop=1"
^
In the above example, the baud rate is specified as 1200 bps, no parity bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit.
If nothing is written in "protocol" (specify ""), the current default value will be used. Normally, you don't have to specify anything.
^
With serial communication instructions, you can control only one port at a time.
Please note that it is not possible to build software that monitors multiple serial ports at the same time.
^
Be sure to open the serial port last, as once initialized, other applications will not be available until you open it. In particular, create a script that calls attention at the end with a onexit command etc. so that you do not press the close box during communication and end.
^
If the serial port is successfully initialized, the value of the system variable stat will be 0.
.. If the initialization fails, the value of the system variable stat will be 1.

Acquires the time stamp information of the file specified by "file" and assigns it to the variable specified by p1.
^
However, the variable of p1 is an array variable, and it is necessary to allocate enough memory to store 24 or more elements of numeric type.
Therefore, the variables specified by the fxtget and fxtset instructions should be used after declaring an array such as "dim a, 24" with the dim instruction in advance. The acquired time stamp information is assigned to each element of the array variable.
For example, if you specify "fxt get a," test "", the information will be assigned to variables a.0 to a.23. The details of the values assigned to each element of the array are as follows.

Change the time stamp information of the file specified by "file" to that of the variable specified by p1.
^
However, the variable of p1 is an array variable, and it is necessary to allocate enough memory to store 24 or more elements of numeric type. The array variable specified by p1 has the same format as that used by the fxtget instruction. For details on the values specified for array variables, refer to the explanation of the fxtget instruction.
If the instruction fails to execute, the system variable stat is assigned 1. If successful, the system variable stat will be 0.
^
The time stamp set by the fxtset instruction may not be set completely depending on the file system of the OS. This is because the file system does not store time in its entirety. For example, for Windows 95 (FAT), the time of the last access date is not recorded. It will be the date only. Also, data in seconds is recorded roughly.
