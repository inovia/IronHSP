csvstr
Convert one line of CSV to an array
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
p1,p2
p1: String type array variable name to which the result is assigned
p2: Character string extracted from one CSV line
%inst
Expands only one line of data extracted from CSV format data into a character string type array variable.
 CSV format is text data separated by ",".
For example, if you have four strings separated by "," such as "a, b, c, d", you can use the csvstr instruction to "a.0 =" a "" and "a.1 =". Each element can be assigned to an array variable separately, such as "b", "a.2 =" c "", and "a.3 =" d "".
The array variable specified by p1 must always be a string type array variable.
^
The number of characters reserved in the array variable and the part that exceeds the limit of the array are ignored. (No error or data corruption)
^
If an error occurs during instruction execution, the system variable stat will be 1.
If converted successfully, the system variable stat will be 0.



%index
csvnote
Convert one line of CSV to memory note
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
p1,p2
p1: String type variable name to which the result is assigned
p2: Character string extracted from one CSV line
%inst
Expands only one line of data extracted from CSV format data into a character string type variable in memory notepad format.
CSV format is text data separated by ",".
For example, if you have four character strings separated by "," such as "a, b, c, d", you can use the csvstr command to make "" a \\ nb \\ nc \\ nd \\ n "". Can be assigned to as the data handled by the memory notepad instruction (data separated by "\\ n").
^
If an error occurs during instruction execution, the system variable stat will be 1.
If converted successfully, the system variable stat will be 0.


%index
xnotesel
Exclusive memory note initialization
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
p1,p2
p1: Target string type variable name
p2: Maximum number of items (256 by default)
%inst
Initializes the exclusive memory note.
The target variable and the reference count are reset.
^
Exclusive memory notes are long string data with one item per line, similar to those used in memory notepad instructions.
However, exclusive memory notes can only add different items (lines).
If you try to add an item that you already have, only the reference count will be updated, not the actual one. This makes it possible to store the same character string without duplication, and apply it to duplicate statistics, character string search, etc.
^
For exclusive memory notes, specify the target variable in xnotesel and set the maximum number of items if necessary.
After that, each time the xnoteadd instruction is executed, an item is added to the variable of the exclusive memory note.
%href
xnoteadd


%index
xnoteadd
Exclusive memory note item added
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
p1
p1: Character string added to the exclusive memory note
%inst
Adds an item to the exclusive memory note.
The item must be a string that does not contain line breaks.
When executed, the index to which the item is added is assigned to the system variable stat.
^
Items that are already in the exclusive memory note are not added.
In that case, the index of the item already included in the system variable stat is assigned, and the reference count of the item is incremented by one.
The reference count of an item can be obtained with the sort get instruction.

%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
val,mode
val: Variable name that stores the character string to be searched by CSV
mode: Delimited character code
%inst
Select the buffer to be searched for CSV.
You can specify a variable that contains a CSV or notepad format string.

You can specify the delimiter character in mode.
If mode is omitted or set to 0, "," is used.
You can support tab-delimited csv files by specifying 9.

%prm
val
val: Variable name to output CSV search results
%inst
Specifies the CSV search result output buffer.
It must be a string type variable with a certain size.
Secure the size in advance with the sdim instruction, etc., according to the expected output result. Usually about 32000 bytes is enough.
If the size of the output result overflows the buffer, the search will be interrupted within the specified buffer size, so buffer overflow will not occur.

"string",p1,p2
"string": Search keyword
p1: Maximum number of result outputs (0 = unlimited)
p2: Start index of result output (0 = beginning)
%inst
Perform a CSV search.
It is necessary to specify the buffer (csvsel) to be searched and the output destination (csvres).
 The CSV line containing the keyword specified by "string" will be extracted to the result buffer.
 Keywords can be specified over multiple lines (memory notepad format).
If you include the AND search option in the csvopt instruction, only the rows that match all of the multiple keywords are fetched.
Otherwise, it will be an OR search that retrieves rows that match any of the multiple keywords.

vsave
Save all variables
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"filename"
"filename": filename
%inst
Saves all defined variable data to a file.
The file specified by "filename" is created.
The saved file can be used to read variable data with the vload or vload_start instruction.
The vsave instruction saves the contents of all variables, including arrays and module variables, but does not cover cloned variables, comobj, or variant variables.
Also, although it is possible to save label type variables, please note that the label information may not be correct when reading.
If successful, the system variable stat is assigned 0.
If the process is not completed correctly, the system variable stat will be a non-zero value.

%index
vload
Read all variables
%group
Extended I / O control instructions
%prm
"filename"
"filename": filename
%inst
Reads all defined variables from the file.
The file specified by "filename" must have variable data saved by the vsave or vsave_start instruction.
The vload instruction searches all currently defined variable names in the data stored in the file and loads the matching names.
Variables that are not saved in the file retain their original contents.
In addition, module type variables are not read unless the module name and the number of module variable definitions are the same as when they were saved.
If successful, the system variable stat is assigned 0.
If the process is not completed correctly, the system variable stat will be a non-zero value.
