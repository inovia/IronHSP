MUCOM88 initialization

%prm
p1, option
p1 (0): Window handle
option (0): Initialization option

%inst
Initialize MUCOM88.
In order to use the various functions of MUCOM88, it is necessary to initialize it first.
The p1 parameter specifies the window handle used by the sound driver.
If p1 is omitted or 0 is specified, the currently active window is targeted.
Normally, specify hwnd (HSP window handle).
The option parameter can specify the following values.
^p
   Value: Content
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
    +1: Disable FM synthesis simulation (fmgen)
    +2: Enable SCCI (scci.dll required)
^p
When SCCI is enabled, FM sound source control on an external device via scci.dll is possible.
For details, refer to the MUCOM 88 manual.
If an error occurs, the system variable stat is assigned a non-zero value.

mucomreset
Reset MUCOM 88

%prm
option
option (0): Reset option

%inst
Reset the MUCOM 88.
All data including the music and timbre data being played will be reset.
When playing music or compiling MML, you need to do a reset first.
The option parameter can specify the following values.
^p
   Label: Content
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
   MUCOM_RESET_PLAYER Reset MUCOM 88 as a music player
   MUCOM_RESET_COMPILE Reset MUCOM88 as MML compiler
   MUCOM_RESET_EXTFILE Do not reference internal files when initializing MML compiler
^p
When resetting, you must always select either the music player (MUCOM_RESET_PLAYER) or the MML compiler (MUCOM_RESET_COMPILE). (If you want to play music after MML compilation, you need to reset it as MML compiler and then reset it again as music player.)
MUCOM_RESET_EXTFILE is an option to read the PC-8801 driver file (muc88, msub, etc.) used by MUCOM88 as an external file. Normally, you do not need to specify it.
If an error occurs, the system variable stat is assigned a non-zero value.

p1 (0): Bank No.

%inst
MUCOM88 Reads music data (.mub).
By specifying the bank number (0 to 15) to read with p1, the file with "filename" is read and prepared for playback.
MUCOM88 music data (.mub) must be created in advance with a music tool (MUCOM88Win) or compiled from an MML file (.muc).
Before using the mucomload command, you must first reset the MUCOM88 as a music player with the mucom reset command.
If an error occurs, the system variable stat is assigned a non-zero value.

Get tag data

%prm
var,"tagname"
var: Variable to which the acquired data is assigned
"tagname": tag string

%inst
Gets the tags defined in the MUCOM88 music data read by the mucomload command.
By specifying the tag character string with "tagname", the definition contents corresponding to the tag character string are assigned to the variable.
If you write "mucom tag a," title "", the contents of the "title" tag will be assigned to the variable a.
If the tag string is specified as an empty string (""), all definition tables are assigned to the variable.
If an error occurs, the variable is assigned an empty string ("") and the system variable stat is assigned a non-zero value.
