p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6
p1 = 0 to (0): Rectangle center X coordinate
p2 = 0 to (0): Y coordinate of the center of the rectangle
p3 = 0 to (0.0): Rotation angle (unit is radian)
p4 = 0 ~ (?): X size
p5 = 0 ~ (?): Y size
%inst
Draws a rectangle (rectangle) of the size specified in (p4, p5) with the currently set color centered on the coordinates specified in (p1, p2).
You can specify the rotation angle as a real number with p3.
The unit of angle is radians (starting from 0 and going around at 2ÉŒ).
The grect instruction reflects the copy mode specification set in gmode.
^
If gmode is 0,1, normal fill.
If gmode is 3, it will be translucent at the specified rate.
When gmode is 5 or 6, color addition and color subtraction are performed respectively.
If the size specification of (p4, p5) is omitted, the copy size set by the gmode instruction is used.
^
The hgrect instruction performs the same operation as the standard instruction grect instruction on the screen of HGIMG3.
This command is a direct drawing command. Drawing is executed when the instruction is executed.
You should always draw directly between hgdraw and hgsync.

Direct drawing of rectangular image
%group
Extended screen control command

p3 = 0 to (0): Upper left Y coordinate of copy source
p4 = 0 to (0.0): Rotation angle (unit is radian)
p5 = 0 ~ (?): X size
p6 = 0 ~ (?): Y size
%inst
The hgrotate command performs texture drawing processing including rotation in the specified rectangular range.
Specify the texture ID of the copy source with p1, and specify the coordinates corresponding to the original image to be copied with (p2, p3). (Similar to the gcopy instruction)
The copy destination is the window ID specified as the current drawing destination, and the copy is performed to the coordinates centered on the location set by the pos command.
At that time, you can specify the rotation angle with a real number with p3.
The unit of angle is radians (starting from 0 and going around at 2ÉŒ).
In (p5, p6), specify the X and Y sizes after copying.
Also, the default copy size set by the gmode instruction is used for the X and Y sizes of the copy source.
In other words, if you specify a size larger than the size specified by the gmode instruction with (p5, p6), it will be expanded.
If (p5, p6) is omitted, copying will be performed in the same size as the copy source, that is, at the same size.
^
The hgrotate instruction reflects the copy mode specification set in gmode.
(See the gmode instruction reference for details)
^
The hgrotate instruction performs the same operation as the standard instruction grottate instruction on the screen of HGIMG3.
This command is a direct drawing command. Drawing is executed when the instruction is executed.
You should always draw directly between hgdraw and hgsync.

%inst
Draws a line connecting the coordinates specified in (p1, p2) to the coordinates specified in (p3, p4) in the currently set color.
The hgline instruction reflects the copy mode specification set in gmode.
^
If gmode is 0,1, normal fill.
If gmode is 3, it will be translucent at the specified rate.
When gmode is 5 or 6, color addition and color subtraction are performed respectively.

Register texture
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
x,y,sw,mode
(x, y): Texture registration size
sw (0): Texture registration switch (0 = normal / 1 = Y inversion)
mode (-1): Update mode specified (-1 = new)
%inst
Registers the contents of the currently selected window ID as a texture.
If the texture is successfully registered, the texture ID will be assigned to the system variable stat.
If it fails, the system variable stat will be negative.
^
If the sw value is 1, the image is flipped upside down and the texture is registered.
If the mode value is -1 or omitted, normal registration processing is performed, and if you specify the texture ID already registered in the mode value, the texture with the same ID will be updated with the current window contents.
^
Normally, use the texload command and texload2 command to read the texture from the file.
%href

%index
texload
Register texture from file
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
"filename"
"filename": Image file of the texture to be registered
%inst
Register the contents of the image file "filename" as a texture.
The image can be the same format (BMP, JPG, GIF) that can be used with the picload command.
When the texture registration is completed, the texture ID is assigned to the system variable stat.
If it fails, an error dialog will be displayed.
^
The texload instruction automatically corrects textures that are not a multiplier of 2 (2,4,8,16Åc) to the correct size.
Please note that if your video card does not support the color mode or size of the texture, you may get an error even if the file exists.
Also, if you want to load a texture that contains an alpha channel, use the texload2 instruction.
^
This instruction is implemented as a module in hgimg3.as.
Also, when loading an image, HSP window ID3 is used internally.

%index
texload2
Register texture from file
%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
"filename",sx,sy
"filename": Image file of the texture to be registered
sx, sy: Reference texture size
%inst
Register the contents of the image file "filename" as a texture.
It behaves the same as the texload instruction, but is loaded using the DirectX API.
Available formats are BMP, JPG, GIF, PNG, DDS, TGA, TIFF, etc.
When the texture registration is completed, the texture ID is assigned to the system variable stat.
If it fails, a negative value is assigned to the system variable stat.
^
Image data including alpha channels such as DDS and TGA files can be enabled by reading with the texload2 instruction.
However, the texload2 instruction may scale the image size to the optimum size according to the specifications of the video card.
Use the texload and texload2 instructions properly as needed.
^
It is possible to forcibly specify the texture size with sx and sy.
Normally, it is okay to omit the specification.

--------------------------------------------------------------
  1 Apply the created toon texture to the model
  2 Save the created toon texture to a file
^p
The maketoon instruction extracts the material color of the model and creates a standard toon texture.
If you specify 2 as the creation mode, the toon texture is saved as "toon.bmp".
The saved toon texture can be loaded and used with the loadtoon command, and by editing the image, it is possible to express finer toon shading.

You can control the modeling with the option parameter.
If the option value is 0 or omitted, the model will be created as usual.
When the option value is 1, the model body is not generated and only the surrounding phosphorescence (SPREAD) is generated.
If the option value is 2, phosphorescent (SPREAD) is not generated and only the model body is generated.

%group
Extended screen control command
%prm
Model,Param,Value
Model: Model ID
Param: Parameter ID
Value: The value to set for the parameter
%inst
Sets the generation parameters for the EPRIM model.
For Model, specify the model ID created by the addprim instruction.
Specify the parameter ID to be set in Param and the value to be set in Value as a real number or an integer.
The parameter ID specified by Param depends on the model shape created by the addprim instruction.
The parameter ID can be set from 0 to 8 with a real value.
Parameter IDs 16 to 19 are color code settings, and 32-bit integer values with Éø and RGB values can be set.
After changing the generation parameters with the seteprim command, the vertex coordinates are reconstructed when displaying.
To reduce the processing load, avoid executing the seteprim instruction every frame,
Make parameter changes only when necessary.

The index value is represented by the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 ... in the order in which multiple animations were read.
You can cancel (stop) the animation by specifying a negative value (-1) for Anim.
In addition, the mode of setting can be specified by the value of mode.
If the setting mode is set to 0 or omitted, the animation is switched immediately.
If you set the setting mode to 1, wait for the currently playing animation to finish before switching.
If you specify a negative value for Anim in setting mode 1, the animation will stop after the current animation has finished playing.
If the animation is played in setting mode 0, the playback speed will be returned to the default value and repeat playback will be performed.
At the start of the animation, the standard animation speed of the model (which can be changed with the modelspeed command) is set.
While the animation is playing, you can change the speed with the objspeed command.

Add animation data to the X-file model.
For ModelID, you need to specify the model ID that has already been read by the addxfile instruction.
If the animation is added successfully, the model ID will be assigned to the system variable stat.
If the animation addition fails, the system variable stat is assigned -1.
^
The addxanim instruction is used when switching between multiple animations in one model.
First, read the data including the entire model and the first animation with the addxfile instruction, and then use the addxanim instruction to register only the additional animation.
Make sure that the model and bone configurations are output from the same source.

Multiple animations can be switched with the objact command.
The animation index value for switching is set to 0 for the animation read by the addxfile instruction first, and then increases to 1,2,3, etc. each time it is added by the addxanim instruction.
^
The maximum number of animations you can add is 16 (including the original x-files) by default.
To increase the maximum number, use the setreq instruction to set the maximum number of animations (SYSREQ_MDLANIM) appropriately.
^
Only the first one can be read from an X file that has multiple animation information. When reading multiple, it is necessary to prepare multiple X files.

The model information indicated by the object ID specified in p2 is used as a character string.
Assigns to the variable specified by p1.
You must always specify the object ID that has the X format model.
Information is assigned to the variable of p1 in the form of a character string.
You can specify the node ID with p2.
The node ID is a number starting from 0, and multiple IDs are assigned to each bone or mesh.
If you specify a negative value such as -1 for the node ID, all node information is returned in the form of one line and one element separated by a line feed code.
This allows you to find out the maximum number of node IDs.
(The maximum number of node IDs is the same for the same model, even if the modes are different.)
You can specify the type of information to be acquired with p4.
The values that can be specified in p4 are as follows.
^p
Mode content
---------------------------------------------
 0 node name
 World coordinates of one node
 2-node X, Y, Z rotation angle
 16 Number of materials in a node
 $ 1000 + MatID Diffuse Color
 $ 2000 + MatID Texture COM pointer (0 when no texture is used)
 $ 10000 + Index Vertex coordinates
 $ 20000 + Index UV coordinates
^p
Use $ 1000 and $ 2000 in combination with the Material ID.
The material ID is a 0-based value assigned to each node, and the number of valid material IDs can be found in mode 16.
^
$ 10000 and $ 20000 are used in combination with the Index in the internal buffer.
You can get the vertex coordinate or UV coordinate values of the specified index.

The mode value can be one of the following:
^p
Mode value Contents
	-----------------------------------------------------
0 Constant (no light source calculation)
1 Gouraud (DirectX standard light source calculation)
2 hemispherical lighting
^p
When the mode value is 0, the material color is always reflected as it is without calculating the light source. (Constant shading)
When the mode value is 0, the light source is calculated considering the light color and ambient color. The display color in this case is
^p
Brightness = Light intensity * Light color * Material color + Ambient color
^p
Is used. (If the brightness exceeds 255, it will be 255.)
When the mode value is 2, the hemispherical lighting is calculated with the light color as the celestial sphere and the ambient color as the ground color.
Hemispherical lighting can express softer and finer shadows than DirectX standard light source calculation.
In the current version, the shading mode setting can only be applied to x-format models.
Also, please note that the scale (color) parameter of the light is not currently reflected in shading mode 1.

Manipulate the coordinates and angle of the object specified by ObjID toward the target value.
In Target, set the target (target mode) to operate.
If it is 0 or omitted, the coordinates will be moved.
In Mode, you can select the content of the operation.

Mode 0: Move (or rotate) toward the target value

Moves (or rotates) toward the coordinates set in the work group information of the object.
(If the target mode is 0, it will move, and if it is 1, it will change the rotation angle.)
It is necessary to set the target coordinates in advance by using the setwork command.
The maximum movement amount per frame can be set by the optional parameters X, Y, Z.
For example, if (1,1,1) is specified, only one move per frame for each of X, Y, and Z will be performed.

Mode 1: Set the amount of movement toward the target value

Similar to Mode0, it moves toward the coordinates set in the work group information of the object.
However, instead of actually moving, set the movement amount in the dir group information.
This is for use when moving toward the specified coordinates when OBJ_MOVE is specified in the object mode.
For this mode, always specify target mode 0 (coordinates).

Mode 4: Set the angle toward the target value

Sets the angle towards the coordinates set in the object's work group information.
It is necessary to set the target coordinates in advance by using the setwork command.
The optional parameters X, Y, Z must specify the vector to which the original model is oriented.
For this mode, always specify target mode 0 (coordinates).

The objaim instruction allows a wide variety of object operations, but its settings are complicated.
It's a good idea to learn while practicing only the functions you need.

The mesh map information assigned to the array variable is reflected in the model.
The mesh map information holds the information of the grid unit divided in the X and Y directions as an integer type array variable. Various information such as UV can be updated in real time, including the height of each mesh vertex.
This allows you to represent undulating ground or map chips.
The updated information changes depending on the value specified in mode.

$ 100 mesh texture mapping
^p
When $ 100 (256) is specified for mode, the UV value for displaying the texture map chip for the terrain divided into 4 is set based on the value (0 to 3) of the mesh map information.

If the coordinates of the mesh change, the normals will be recalculated.
In that case, add 16 to the mode value to create a smooth normal.
(However, it is computationally expensive and applies to those that do not use repeating textures in the mesh map).

The meshmap instruction sets values for all vertices based on the contents of the array variable.
The factor factor is applied uniformly to the set value.
In other words, even if the value stored in the variable is 15, if you specify 0.1 for factor, the actual value set will be 1.5.
By using it in combination with the getvarmap command, you can set the height and map chip based on the image data.

%inst
Sets the object movement angle factor when the emitter specified by id is generated.
When the emitter spawns an object, the angle in the direction of movement is calculated.
Basically, in the case of EMITMODE_RANDOM mode, the movement direction is randomly selected from 360 degrees all around, and in the case of EMITMODE_CIRCLE mode, it is evenly distributed by the number of 360 degrees all around.
The angle factor is a number that is multiplied by this angle.
This makes it possible to set movement within a limited range such as 180 degrees and 90 degrees as well as 360 degrees all around.
For example, if 0.5 is specified for the angle coefficient, the calculation will be performed on half of the entire circumference (180 degrees). Furthermore, the range of movement can be freely set by setting the angle addition value with the emit_angopt command.
The angle coefficient can be set individually for each X, Y, and Z axes. Also, in the case of 2D sprites, only Z-axis rotation is reflected.
For emitters for which emit_angmul is not set, (1,1,1) is set as the initial value.

id (0): Emitter ID
dx (0.0): X coordinate value (real number)
dy (0.0): Y coordinate value (real number)
dz (0.0): Z coordinate value (real number)
%inst
Generates the emitter specified by id from the coordinates of (dx, dy, dz).
It is necessary to set the object to be generated from the emitter in advance.
After execution, the total number of generated objects is assigned to the system variable stat.
Use the setobjemit instruction to apply an emitter to a placed object.

p1 (0): Object ID
p2 (0): Emitter ID
%inst
Sets the placed object as the origin of the emitter.
Assigns the emitter of p2 to the object specified by p1.
After that, it will also operate as an emitter when displaying an object.
You can cancel the application of the emitter by specifying a negative value for the emitter ID.

dz (0.0): Z operation value (real number)
opt (0): Calculation method
%inst
Perform operations collectively on models that belong to the same collision group.
Of all the valid objects, the one that specifies the collision group specified by the group parameter is the target of the operation.
Multiple bits can be combined in the collision group specified by the group parameter. For example, if you specify group 1 and group 2 at the same time, the value is 3.
The mocid parameter specifies a value that indicates the MOC group. The following can be specified for the MOC group.
^p

  pos           0
  ang           1
  scale         2
  dir           3
  efx           4
  work          5
^p
Use (dx, dy, dz) to set the value used in the operation.
The method of operation is specified by the opt parameter. The following can be specified for the opt parameter.
^p
  opt calculation method
---------------------------
   0 substitution
   1 addition
   2 subtraction
   3 multiplication
^p
When opt is omitted or 0 is specified, the value of (dx, dy, dz) is assigned to the target object as it is.
For other values, (dx, dy, dz) is calculated on the already assigned (X, Y, Z) value.
