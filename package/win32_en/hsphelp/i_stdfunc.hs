%group
Basic input / output functions
%prm
(p1)
p1: Source value or variable

%inst
Returns an integer version of the value specified by p1.
If the value is real, it will be truncated after the decimal point.
If the value is a string, it will be that number if it is a numeric string, otherwise it will be 0.

%group
Basic input / output functions
%prm
(p1)
p1 = 1 to 32768: Random number range

%inst
Generates an integer random value in the range 0 to (p1-1).
The value of p1 is not included in the range. For example
^p
Example:
    a=rnd(10)
^p
Assigns a random number from 0 to 9 to the variable a.
The rnd function generates random numbers in a certain pattern after the program is started.
If you want the random number pattern to be non-constant, use the randomize instruction.

callfunc
Calling an external function
%group
Basic input / output functions
%prm
(p1,p2,p3)
p1: Array variable containing parameters
p2: Function address
p3: Number of parameters

%inst
Calls the address specified in p2 as a native function.
Use the value stored in the numeric array variable specified by p1 as the argument of the call. You can specify the number of parameters with p3.
^p
Example:
	a.0=1
	a.1=2
	a.2=3
	res = callfunc( a, proc, 3 )
^p
In the above example, the function at the address indicated by proc is called with the argument (1,2,3).
The return value of the called function becomes the return value of callfunc as it is.
This function is used in special situations where you prepare and call the function address yourself.
Normally you do not need to use it. Also, if the external function call fails, it may freeze or cause unexpected results, so be careful when using it.

If the value of p1 is less than p2, the value of p2 is returned, and if the value of p1 is greater than p3, the value of p3 is returned.
As a result, the value returned by the limit function is always in the range of p2 to p3.

If it is a modular variable, you can check whether it is unused (0), initialized (1), or a clone of another variable (2).
If it is a COM object type, you can check if you have a valid COM object.

libptr
Get the information address of the external call command
%group
Basic input / output functions
%prm
(p1)
p1: Command to look up the address

%inst
Gets the information address of the command specified in p1 and returns it as an integer value.
By specifying an external DLL call command or function as a parameter, you can get the address of the STRUCTDAT structure that stores information about the command.
The STRUCTDAT structure is defined in the HSPSDK as follows:
^p
	typedef struct STRUCTDAT {
	short	index;           // base LIBDAT index
	short	subid;           // struct index
	int	prmindex;            // STRUCTPRM index(MINFO)
	int	prmmax;              // number of STRUCTPRM
	int	nameidx;             // name index (DS)
	int	size;                // struct size (stack)
	int	otindex;             // OT index(Module)  / cleanup flag(Dll)
	union {
		void	*proc;       // proc address
		int	funcflag;        // function flags(Module)
	};
	} STRUCTDAT;
^p
When a COM call command, user-defined command, or user-defined function is specified in p1, the address of the STRUCTDAT structure is obtained in the same way.
The libptr function assists in accessing the internal data used by HSP, so please be sure to have sufficient knowledge about the contents of the information handled here.
In normal use, you don't need to use or remember this function.
^
By referring to the STRUCTDAT structure, it is possible to obtain information such as the address of the externally called DLL and the DLL handle.

p1 must always be positive. If it is negative, no error will occur, but a non-number (-1. # IND00) will be returned.
p2 can be either positive or negative. You can also specify a real number.

%group
Basic input / output functions
%prm
(p1,p2)
p1 (0): Time elapsed value (integer value)
p2 (4096): Maximum time elapsed value (integer value)
%inst
Acquires the calculation result value of the easing function that interpolates the numerical value in the determined range with an arbitrary formula as an integer.
Before using the easing function, it is necessary to set the minimum value, maximum value, and calculation formula output by the setease instruction.
The time elapsed value specified by p1 is an integer value starting from 0, and by specifying up to the maximum time elapsed value (p2 parameter), the calculation result of the easing function is returned.
If you omit the maximum value (p2 parameter), 4096 is used.
Normally, if the elapsed time value is negative, it is considered to be 0. Also, if the elapsed time value exceeds the maximum value (p2 parameter), it is treated as the maximum value.
(However, if ease_loop (interpolation loop) is added in the type setting of the calculation formula by the setease instruction, the interpolation loop (repetition) is performed including the values outside the range.)

Acquires the calculation result value of the easing function that interpolates the numerical value in the determined range with an arbitrary calculation formula as a real number.
Before using the easing function, it is necessary to set the minimum value, maximum value, and calculation formula output by the setease instruction.
The time elapsed value specified by p1 is a real value starting from 0, and by specifying up to the maximum time elapsed value (p2 parameter), the calculation result of the easing function is returned.
If you omit the maximum value (p2 parameter), 1.0 is used.
Normally, if the elapsed time value is negative, it is considered to be 0. Also, if the elapsed time value exceeds the maximum value (p2 parameter), it is treated as the maximum value.
(However, if ease_loop (interpolation loop) is added in the type setting of the calculation formula by the setease instruction, the interpolation loop (repetition) is performed including the values outside the range.)
The geteasef instruction gets the calculation result of the finer easing function. If you want to get a value that is passed as an integer, such as a normal coordinate value, it is faster to use the getease function.
