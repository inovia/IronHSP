HSPDB ver3.4  REFERENCE MANUAL                      HSP : Hot Soup Processor  
HSP Extension DLL Reference copyright 2004-2014 (c) onion software
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

・ Introduction

This DLL can be used with Hot Soup Processor ver3 or later for Windows.
It is a plug-in that enables access to various databases via ODBC.
New instructions are added by using this extension DLL.
By using HSPDB, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, dBase, Paradox, etc.
Access a database with the corresponding ODBC driver and control with SQL
Will be possible. To use HSPDB, ODBC and compatible drivers for Windows
Must be installed.


・ Overview of usage

The extension plug-in file, HSPDB.DLL, has an executable file such as HSP3.EXE.
Place it in the same location as the directory.
When using HSPDB, be sure to say "#include" hspdb.as "" at the beginning of the script.
Please add a line. With the above, the function of HSP has been expanded and explained in this reference.
You will be able to use the instructions you are using.
First of all, try running the included sample script (test ??. As).
You should be able to see a simple usage example of the enhanced functionality.


ツキChange log

	2003/9/1 ver1.1

Fixed a bug that the end code (0) may not be acquired correctly.

	2003/3/7 ver1.0

First version.
The operation test is performed in the environment of MySQL + MyODBC.


ツキimportant point

HSPDB.DLL is a plug-in file that is used at the same time as HSP3.EXE.
Even if you create an EXE file, put HSPDB.DLL in the same directory as the EXE file.
It will not work unless it is placed in. Also, you cannot add DLLs to the packfile.

・ Instruction list

Initialize dbini ODBC
dbbye HSPDB termination processing
dbopen "...", mode Connect to DB
dbclose disconnect DB
dbstat Get current state
dbspchr p1 Specify the delimiter
dbsend "..." send SQL string
dbgets p1 Get the result string


・ ODBC instruction

An instruction set for accessing various databases via ODBC.

Initialize dbini ODBC

Initialize ODBC.
It must be done only once at the beginning.
After execution, the result is stored in the system variable stat.
If it is 0, it means that it ended normally, otherwise it means that an error has occurred.


dbbye HSPDB termination processing

Performs the termination processing of the entire HSPDB.
Normally, this instruction is called automatically at the end of the program, so
There is no need to write it in a script.


dbopen "...", mode Connect to DB

"..." = Connection specification string
mode = connection mode (0 to 1, default = 0)

Starts a connection to the DB specified by the connection specification character string.
In addition to being able to specify a DSN name such as "DSN = TEST", the connection specification string
It is possible to describe various parameters such as drivers and files as character strings.
For more information on the connection specification string, refer to the ODBC related documents.
If the connection mode is 1, a dialog for confirming the connection will pop up.
If the connection mode is 0, the connection will be made with the specified character string.
After execution, the result is stored in the system variable stat.
If it is 0, it means that it ended normally, otherwise it means that an error has occurred.


dbclose disconnect DB

Disconnects the DB connected by the dbopen instruction.


dbstat Get current state

Assign the current connection status etc. to the system variable stat.

stat | state
		------------------------------------------------------
1 Error occurred
2 Cutting
3 Connecting
4 Waiting for SQL response


dbspchr p1 Specify the delimiter

p1 = 0 to 255 (character code)

Set the character to separate the items of the result obtained by the dbgets instruction.
Normally, items are separated by ",", but if you want to use different characters, set it.
Please go. For example, if you specify "dbspchr 9", the TAB code will be
It becomes a delimiter.


dbsend "..." send SQL string

"..." = SQL string

Sends the control string according to the SQL syntax to the connected DB.
After execution, the result is stored in the system variable stat.
If it is 0, it means that it ended normally, otherwise it means that an error has occurred.
If it ends normally, you can get the result with the dbgets instruction.


dbgets p1 Get the result string

p1 = variable name to which the resulting string is assigned

Gets the result for the SQL string sent by the dbsend instruction.
In p1, you need to specify the variable name to which the result string will be assigned.
The variable specified by p1 is forced to be a string type, and the size of the variable buffer is
Receive as much data as you can (buffer never overflows).
After execution, the result is stored in the system variable stat.
If it is 0, it means that the data was received normally.
A value of 1 indicates that an error occurred while retrieving the result.
A case of 2 indicates that there is no more data to receive.
When retrieving data, retrieving large data in multiple batches
There is a possibility, so if the content of the system variable stat is 0,
Run dbgets again and loop until it receives the data to the end
please.
