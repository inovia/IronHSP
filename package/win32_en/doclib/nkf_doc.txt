nkf --Document for Kanji code conversion filter for network
(This document is based on the nkf-2.1.0 document nkf.doc)

Å° Overview

    nkf
    Is a kanji code designed for reading and writing emails and news on the network.
    This is a conversion filter.

    The feature of this nkf is the statistical automatic recognition function of the input kanji code system.
    Therefore, the user does not need to know what the input kanji code system is, but the output kanji.
    You only have to specify the code system.
    However, although this judgment mechanism is not perfect in theory, it is used for ordinary news and emails.
    The message is secure and works reliably.

    Currently, the input kanji code system that nkf can recognize is the so-called JIS code.
    (Based on ISO-2022-JP), Shift_JIS (MS Kanji code), Japanese EUC (AT & T)
    Code), UTF-8, or UTF-16.
    These are also the Kanji code systems to be output.
    If you do not specify a file, the input will be standard input.
    The output is standard output.


Å° Option

    The options that can be specified are as follows. Can be continued like -mu.
    ('-' Is not required when specifying with SetNkfOption)

    -j Output JIS code.

    -e Print EUC code.

    -s Output Shift_JIS code.

    -w -w8[0] -w16[BL][0]
        Output Unicode.

        -w -w80
            Output UTF8 code. (No BOM)

        -w8 Output UTF8 code.

        -w16 -w16B0
            Output UTF16 code. (No Big Endian / BOM)

        -w16B
            Output UTF16 code. (With Big Endian / BOM)

        -w16L
            Output UTF16 code. (With Little Endian / BOM)

        -w16L0
            Output UTF16 code. (No Little Endian / BOM)

    -m[BQSN0]
        Decrypt MIME. (Default) ISO-2022-JP (B encode) and ISO-8859-1
        Decode only (Q encode). When decoding ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), -l
        Flags are also needed. -m0 does not decrypt MIME. -mB, -mQ
        Then, it is processed as if it is BASE64, Q encoded.

        -mB Decrypt the MIME base64 stream. Remove headers, etc.

        -mQ Decipher the MIME quoted stream.

        -mS Tighten MIME checks (default)

        -mN Loosen the MIME check

        -m0 Do not decrypt MIME.

        -mS is the content of the declaration followed by encoded-text
        Check the integrity of. -mN is MIME delimited by line breaks
        Etc. are also deciphered. Decoding may not stop.

        Convert to MIME.

        -M Convert to header format

        -Convert to MB base64 stream

        -Convert to MQ Quoted stream

    -x The so-called half-width kana (JIS X 0201 katakana) that is usually performed
        From so-called double-byte kana (JIS X 0208 katakana)
        Save half-width kana without converting to. Input is 1 byte of Shift_JIS
        Kana, SO / SI, ESC-(-I, SSO are accepted. Output is in Japanese EUC
        ESC-(-I is used by default in SSO and JIS codes.

    -X So-called half-width kana (JIS X 0201 katakana) to so-called full-width kana (JIS X 0208)
        Convert to katakana).

    -B Broken JIS code. Suppose the ESC is gone.

        -B1 ESC-(, ESC- $ followed by any code

        -B2 Forces back to ASCII after line break

    -f[*m*[-*n*]]
        * N * margins so that there are * m * characters per line
        Perform simple shaping as. The default is 60 characters and 10 margins
        Is.

    -Z[0-3]
        JIS X 0208 Converts alphanumeric characters and some symbols to ASCII.
        That is, full-width is converted to half-width.

        -Z -Z0
            Convert X0208 alphabet to ASCII.

        -Z1 JIS X 0208 Converts Japanese character spacing to one ASCII space.

            It was used only in the code and should not be used at this time.

    -r Convert ROT13 / 47.

    -g Outputs the result of automatic determination.

    -T Output in text mode. (Valid only on MS-DOS)

    -l Treat the code 0x80-0xfe as ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1). JIS
        Valid only in combination with code output. Incompatible with -s, -e, -x.

    -O Output to a file. Unnecessary feature on UNIX but Windows and MSDOS
        Then it seems necessary.
        The last file name will be the output file name and will be overwritten, not the argument immediately after.
        Be careful as it will end up. Nkf.out if there is no file name.

    --jis --euc --sjis --mime --base64
        Make the corresponding conversion.

    --hiragana --katakana
        Hiragana and Katakana conversion

    --fb-{skip, html, xml, perl, java, subchar}
        From Unicode to Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, ISO-2022-JP
        When converting to, you can specify how to handle the characters that could not be converted.

    --prefix=*escape character**target character*..
        2nd byte when converting from EUC-JP to Shift_JIS
        You can add an escape character before the character that appears in. Argument 1
        The character is an escape character, 2
        Specifies the character to be escaped after the first character.

        For example

        With --prefix = \\ $ @, the second character of Shift_JIS is $ or @
        Is inserted before it, with --prefix = @@, Shift_JIS
        When @ comes in the second character of, @ is inserted before it

    --no-cp932ext
        NEC special characters, NEC-selected IBM extended characters (89-92) extended in CP932
        Ward), does not convert IBM extended characters.

    --no-best-fit-chars
        Unicode
        When converting from, characters that do not ensure round-trip safety are not converted.
        Specifying with -x when converting from Unicode to Unicode makes nkf UTF
        It can be used for format conversion.
        (Conversely, if you do not specify this, some characters will not be saved)

        Force to specify this option when converting strings related to paths
        Highly recommended.

    --cap-input, --url-input
        Converts the hexadecimal number following: and% to a character, respectively

    --numchar-input
        Convert Unicode character references like & # ....;

    --in-place[=*SUFFIX*] --overwrite[=*SUFFIX*]
        Replace the original file with the conversion result.
        It is also possible to rewrite multiple files.
        The time stamp and permissions of the original file are preserved.
        Currently created date and time and inode
        Will change, but there is no guarantee that this implementation will remain in the future.

    --guess
        Output the result of automatic discrimination

    --help
        Display a brief description of the command.

    -V Show nkf settings.

        (Define EXEC_IO in config.h)
        Valid only when compiling with

    --exec-out
        nkf [options] --exec-out cmd args ... will output nkf to cmd
        (Define EXEC_IO in config.h)
        Valid only when compiling with

Å° BUGS

    Actually, the judgment of the input code system is Shift_JIS and EUC.
    It is an automatic judgment of, and it is confirmed when the first identifiable character arrives.
    Then, during the unspecified period, it is stored in the hold buffer and processed after confirmation.
    Therefore, 7-bit JIS is always recognized. Shift_JIS, EUC
    Mixing is fine in most cases. However, Shift_JIS so-called half-width kana
    (JIS X 0201 Katakana) and EUC Kanji cannot be distinguished.
    Therefore, by default Shift_JIS
    It is assumed that there is no so-called half-width kana. (That is, Shift_JIS or EUC
    If in doubt, consider it as EUC)

    Unicode
    It does not support conversion of non-Japanese parts of, but --no-best-fit-chars
    If you specify, it is possible to convert between UTF-8 and UTF-16.
