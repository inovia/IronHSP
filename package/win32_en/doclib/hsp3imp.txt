HSP3IMP.DLL ver3.5                                  HSP : Hot Soup Processor  
HSP Extension DLL Reference copyright 1999-2017 (c) onion software
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ÅE Introduction

This DLL is used to call functions equivalent to Hot Soup Processor ver3.5 from the outside.
It is something to use.
HSP3IMP.DLL has the same functionality as the HSP3 runtime.
For applications written in common languages such as C / C ++ as well as HSP
HSP functions can be added.
The operation screen of HSP3IMP.DLL is a child window of the specified window.
Since it works, you can use the screen of HSP3 in the same way as pasting parts.
Is possible.

You can also use HSP3IMP.DLL itself as an HSP plug-in.
In that case, place HSP3IMP.DLL in the same directory as HSP3.EXE.
Please use it.


-Call from script

To call the DLL from an HSP script, add the following line to the beginning of the script
please do it.

	#include "hsp3imp.as"

After that, instructions will be added to use the functions of HSP3IMP.DLL.


ÅE Instruction details

	hspini mode,xsize,ysize,handle

mode: Initialization mode ($ 100 = Initialize as child window)
bit0 = window hidden (ON / OFF)
bit1 = Current directory change prohibited (ON / OFF)

xsize: HSP initialization window size (X)
ysize: HSP initialization window size (Y)
handle: Parent window handle (HWND)

Initialize HSP3IMP.DLL.
Initializes HSP3 and reads the object file.
Before executing hspini, make various settings with the hspprm instruction.
Must be kept.
	hspbye

Destroy the instance of HSP3 initialized by the hspini instruction.
It must be executed at the end to finish HSP3.

	hspexec

Executes the HSP3 task initialized by the hspini instruction.
The hspexec instruction is issued until the executed code ends or an error occurs.
I won't come back. (In the meantime, HSP3 tasks will run.)
HSP3IMP.DLL should only work as a single task
Please note that it is a prerequisite.

	hspprm p1,p2,p3,p4

Make settings and get information about HSP3IMP.DLL.
The contents specified from p2 to p4 change depending on the value of p1.
Refer to the following for the parameters to be set.

		p1(mode)
		-----------------------------------------------------------
0 Specify display offset from parent window
(Set the X and Y offset values with p2 and p3)
1 Specify startup parameter (used only for HSPTV)
0x100 Get pointer to HSPCTX structure
(The result will be written to the address specified in p4)
0x101 Function specification to initialize extended instruction
(Register a function that takes an HSP3TYPEINFO pointer as an argument on p4)
0x102 Specify HSP3 object file name
(Set the address where the file name is stored in p4)


-Call from C / C ++

You can call it from C with the following code.

	typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *HSP3FUNC)(int,int,int,int);
	typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *HSP3FUNC2)(int,int,int,void *);
	HINSTANCE h_hspimp;
	HSP3FUNC hspini;
	HSP3FUNC hspbye;
	HSP3FUNC hspexec;
	HSP3FUNC2 hspprm;

// System Initalize (when using COM)
	if ( FAILED( CoInitializeEx( NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED) ) ) {
Alertf ("OLE initialization failed");
		goto cleanup;
	}
	OleInitialize( NULL );
	InitCommonControls();

	h_hspimp = LoadLibrary( "hsp3imp.dll" );
	if ( h_hspimp != NULL ) {
		hspini = (HSP3FUNC)GetProcAddress( h_hspimp, "_hspini@16" );
		hspbye = (HSP3FUNC)GetProcAddress( h_hspimp, "_hspbye@16" );
		hspexec = (HSP3FUNC)GetProcAddress( h_hspimp, "_hspexec@16" );
		hspprm = (HSP3FUNC2)GetProcAddress( h_hspimp, "_hspprm@16" );
	}

The function call looks like this:

hspprm (0, offsetx, offsety, NULL); // X, Y offset
hspini (0x100, sizex, sizey, (int) hWnd); // HSP initialization
hspprm (0x100, 0, 0, & hspctx); // Get HSPCTX
hspexec (0,0,0,0); // HSP execution
hspbye (0,0,0,0); // HSP termination process

	if ( h_hspimp != NULL ) {
		FreeLibrary( h_hspimp );
		h_hspimp = NULL;
	}


important point

HSP3IMP.DLL provides almost the same functionality as HSP3.
Please note the following points as some parts are not supported.

Å° COM initialization (CoInitializeEx, etc.) is not performed inside HSP3IMP.DLL.
When using COM related instructions, as in "Calling from C / C ++"
You will need the initialization code. (When used as a HSP3 plug-in,
No problem. )

Å° run instruction is not supported
Å° The function to clear the mouse cursor by the mouse command is not supported.
Å° Delete instruction is not supported
Å° You cannot access system related folders such as windows
