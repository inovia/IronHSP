high_school_girl ・ ・ ・ Normal body model
high_school_girlSD ・ ・ Deformed model


■ hgimg3 folder

Contains data and scripts that run on the hgimg3 runtime.
samples 1 to 4 are sample scripts.
From a simple model display to a demo running around rugged terrain.
The model files (.x format) that can be read are as follows.

tamane_s.x "Tamane" Standby pose
tamane_w.x "Tamane" walking pose
tamane_r.x "Tamane" Running pose

tamane2_s.x Deformed version "Tamane" Standby pose
tamane2_w.x Deformed version "Tamane" walking pose
tamane2_r.x Deformed version "Tamane" running pose


■ hgimg4 folder

Contains data and scripts that run on the hgimg4 runtime.
(Even if you create an executable file, the data contained under the res folder is always required.)
hgimg4 is a plugin under development and will be a preview version of the model display and animation.
Future versions support finer animation control (motion blending, etc.)
Will be done.
The model files (.x format) that can be read are as follows.

tamane.gpb "Tamane" Standby pose
tamane2.gpb Deformed version "Tamane" Standby pose
