繝サ Introduction

HSP3 Source Converter is a tool for converting HSP3 code to other sources,
And the library.
HSP3 Source Converter can transfer HSP source scripts on other systems as much as possible.
It is a conversion for operation, and all HSP source scripts are converted.
There is no guarantee.


ツキhow to use

The HSP3 source converter uses the HSP3 Dish helper (hsp3dh) or
You can use it by calling hsp3cnv.exe directly from the command line (prompt).
When converting with GUI, select "Tools"-> "Convert specified file to C source" menu of HSP script editor.
Select and call HSP3Dish helper.
After that, specify the conversion source script and press the "Convert" button.
A C language source with the extension of the source script "cpp" is generated.
At this time, by turning on the check of "Convert output source to UTF-8",
You can generate a source whose character code is in UTF-8 format.
This is required when transferring sources to platforms other than Windows.
If you compile it on Windows, you don't need to convert it to UTF-8.


・ About hsp3cnv.exe

A command line application that converts HSP3 object files (ax) to C source.

hsp3cnv filename

Run it on the command line (prompt), like.
For example, if you want to convert test.ax

	hsp3cnv test

It is OK if you specify as.
If successful, it will output a test.cpp file based on the test.ax file.
* Even if you do not use the command line, you can use the ax file (object file) icon.
If you drop it on hsp3cnv, a cpp file will be created in the same folder.

The output file is compiled on the test project (hsp3rtest)
It is possible to.

hsp3cnv -d filename

If is specified, the HSP3Dish source conversion mode is set.
HSP3Dish source conversion mode is for checking instructions of external plug-ins, etc.
Check for compatibility with other platforms.


・ About the test project

A library is provided for linking with the source output by hsp3cnv.

hspsdk\hsp3cnv\hsp3rtest.zip

By unzipping, the hsp3rtest project and the hsp3 project provided by OpenHSP will be generated.
It works on Windows by opening hsp3rtest.vcproj with VC ++ and building it.
Create an exe file.
This project file is for VC ++ 2005, but you can use it in 2008 and Express as well.
The source output by hsp3cnv is registered in the project as test.cpp.
If you want to use the user-generated cpp source, rename it to test.cpp or
You need to re-register the file in the project.


・ About performance

Currently, it is about 2 to 5 times faster than the interpreter (normal) version of HSP3.
(Please note that if you keep the Debug build, it will be significantly slower)
Further speedup by using VC ++'s PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization)
You can plan.

In addition, OpenHSP is equipped with a JIT compiler that uses llvm by zakki.
A version has also been created. This is compiled directly from the ax file
It runs at the same speed.

揃 Supported features

This version is a preview version, and its operation is limited to the following contents.

-Basic instructions, basic functions, and system variables supported by HSP3
-Variables of type int, double, str, label
-Module functions other than module variables (#module, #global)
-User-defined instructions and functions (#deffunc, #defcfunc)
-DLL and plug-in call (temporary support)

The following features are not yet supported.

-Expansion of variable type and command type by plug-in
-COM object operation, COM type-Variant type variable
-Module variable
-Dll function pointer acquisition function by varptr function

The following features are not planned to be supported on this system.

繝サ Run command


繝サ Future plans

HSP3 Source Converter converts HSP3 source code to other platforms and
It is a system for converting to other language sources.
First of all, I am aiming to convert to C source code, but other things such as ActionScript
We have prepared a library that can be used for general purposes with the environment in mind.
