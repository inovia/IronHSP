<h2 id = "FIRST"> Introduction </h2>
		<p>
With HSP, it is possible to add functions in the form of extension plug-ins and modules.
This makes it possible to perform processing that cannot be achieved with the HSP itself.
		</p>
		<p>
HSP extension plug-ins are standard files with DLL or HPI extensions.
This file must be in the same directory as the HSP itself (HSP3.EXE)
It will not be.
Also, when creating an EXE file, you can put it in a PACKFILE to make one EXE file.
can not. If you created an EXE file that uses the extension plug-in,
Put the extension plugin in the same directory.
		</p>
		<p>
Modules are files for adding functionality like extension plugins,
It is used by adding it to the source script.
Unlike HSP extension plugins, modules are in the same directory as the EXE file
You don't need to put the file.
		</p>
		<p>
The following extension plug-ins are included as standard.
Please refer to the separate text for details on how to use each plugin.

This module is for simple 3D display with HSP standard runtime. <br>
Because it does not depend on DirectX or 3D accelerator, the same execution result can be obtained in many environments.
It is very useful when you want to easily use a 3D display.
Also, if you use d3module and HSPLet, you only need to know HSP.
One of the benefits is that you can create 3D applets that run on your browser.
					</p>

This module is made by Mr. S. Programs and is included in the HSP main unit.

SQLele is a module for easy handling of SQLite with HSP. <br>
For example, media player file list, address book and calendar data, image processing software Undo / Redo management, character dialogue in the game, save data and high score. .. .. <br>
In order to manage the data inside such applications, I have used HSP to some extent with the experience of designing data structures and manipulating them with string manipulation instructions and memory manipulation instructions, and writing routines for sorting and extraction. I think most users have it. <br>
I think that it is enough for many apps in terms of function and performance, but if you want to efficiently develop apps that handle complex data, why not try using a free SQL database engine called SQLite? <br>
With SQLite, you only need to add one DLL to your HSP app to use the SQL database in your application. There is no need to install a DB server or configure ODBC settings.
