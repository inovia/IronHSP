1. 1. About this DLL
It was sold by Morphy Planning (http://www.morphyplanning.co.jp/)
It is a plug-in for using USB-IO from HSP.

Since the Morphy project that used to sell USB-IO has disappeared,
I didn't have an inexpensive USB-IO,
The same thing from Technokit (http://www.technokit.biz/) for junior high school
It is sold as a teaching material.

It also supports USB-IO of Km2Net (http://km2net.com/) (03.12.08).


I intend to handle multiple USB-IOs, but I haven't verified it very much.
If it doesn't work, please contact us.

2. Install & run
Copy hspusbio.dll to the HSP folder.
When executing the created exe, place it in the same directory as the exe.

3. 3. how to use
Include hspusbio.as at the beginning of the script.
Search and initialize USB-IO with uio_find, and then
Read and write with uio_inp / out.
You can switch between multiple USB-IOs with uio_seldev.
(Automatically the first time you run uio_inp / out without running uio_find
uio_find is called. However, since it is only the first time, USB-IO was removed once,
If it is inserted again, it will not work properly, so explicitly set uio_find
please call me)

In the case of HSP3.0, there is mod_usbio.as implemented as a module, so
If you include it, you can use it without DLL.

Instruction description
„ÉÉT Uio_find
Search and initialize USB-IO from the device.
If it fails, an error code will be returned to stat.
ÉcÉLError code
0: Normal
1: No required driver (for example, if you have not connected USB-IO yet)
2: USB-IO is not connected

„ÉÉT Uio_free
Release USB-IO.
It is called automatically when HSP is finished, but even if you call it manually
There is no harm.

„ÉÉT Uio_out p1, p2 (, p3)
p1‚ÄÉí Output I / O port address (0 to 1)
p2‚ÄÉí Output content (8 bits)
p3‚ÄÉí mode
If it fails, 1 is returned to stat
If 1 is specified for p3, a pulse is sent to p1 of port 1 to rewrite port 0.

„ÉÉT Uio_inp p1, p2 (, p3)
8-bit read
p1‚ÄÉí Variable to read data
p2‚ÄÉí I / O port address (0 to 1)
p3‚ÄÉí mode
If it fails, a non-zero value will be returned to stat.
If 1 is specified for p3, a pulse is sent to p1 of port 1 and read from port 0.

ÅE Uio_getdevs
The number of connected USB-IOs returns to stat.

ÅE Uio_seldev p1
p1Åc number (value obtained from 0 to uio_getdevs)
