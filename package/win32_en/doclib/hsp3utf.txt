・ What is HSP3UTF?

HSP3UTF runs the standard HSP3 runtime on a unicode (UTF-8) character basis.
It has the same function as the normal HSP3 runtime, but only handles strings.
It is unicode (UTF-8).
It is possible to handle characters that cannot be expressed by the standard HSP that handles SJIS character codes.
We plan to continue evolving as the new HSP3.


・ How to use HSP3Dish

You need to add the following code to the first line:

	#include "hsp3utf.as"

After that, you can write the source like a normal HSP3 script.
The operation and handling of character strings is the same as usual, but with the noteload and notesave instructions
The text file to be handled is UTF-8 code.

The sample script is included in the sample / hsp3utf folder, so
Please try to reference.


・ Conversion by hspcmp

In the current version, the character code to be edited with the script editor is
Since it is SJIS, the source code itself cannot be written in unicode.
However, write the source code in UTF-8 format with your own editor and write it in UTF-8 format.
By compiling with the command line compiler (hspcmp)
It is also possible to describe the source in UTF-8 format.
From the command line

		hspcmp -i script.hsp

By executing like, script.hsp is converted to script.ax as UTF-8 format.


-Newly added instructions

To support SJIS format strings when using HSP3UTF runtime
You can use some additional instructions.

cnvatos (p1) Convert ANSI string to regular string

p1 = variable: the name of the variable from which the contents are read

Read the data stored in the variable as an ANSI (Shift JIS) character string,
A function that returns a converted string.

cnvstoa p1, "string" Converts regular strings to ANSI strings

p1 = variable: variable name to write the result
"string": conversion source string

Converts the data specified in "Character string" to ANSI (Shift JIS) character string
Save it in the variable buffer.
Convert to the variable specified by p1 as a character string type in advance
You need to ensure that you have a sufficient buffer size.

Please note that these instructions will result in an error in standard HSP3.


・ About dll call

The character string passed in str, sptr format when calling the dll from the HSP3UTF runtime is
The string is passed in SJIS code for compatibility with normal HSP3.
However, the character string stored in the variable and the character string in the buffer are not converted, so
Please note that the character code may not be passed correctly in some plugins and APIs.
To the last, the HSP3UTF runtime is a system that handles UTF8 format, so
Please be aware that it may not be compatible with normal HSP3.


ツキFuture plans

The HSP3UTF runtime will be tested for stable operation in the future.
Eventually the runtime of HSP3Dish, HGIMG4, HSP3_64, HSP3MT
We are considering replacing it with UTF-8 base.
(It is already working on UTF-8 base on android, iOS, emscripten of HSP3Dish)

The regular versions of HSP3 and HGIMG3 will continue to be provided with the same character code.
