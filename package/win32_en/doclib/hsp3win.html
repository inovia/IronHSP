<h2 id = "ABOUT_HSP"> Overview </h2>
		<p>
HSP Windows is a development environment for HSP3 that runs on Microsoft Windows. <br>
It is the most standard development environment in the HSP3 family that can be programmed by script.
This document describes features and startup methods that are specific to the Windows version.
See <a href="hsp3.htm"> HSP3 Overview </a> for a basic explanation.
		</p>

<h2 id = "DOUSA_ENV"> Operating environment </h2>
		<ul>
<li> Microsoft Windows 2000, XP (including NT4.0 or later), Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
HSP3.6 works on almost any Windows running 32-bit applications. <br>
We have also confirmed that it works on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and Vista 64bit (x64) versions.
		</p>
		<pre>
The standard "HSP Script Editor" does not work on versions prior to Windows 2000.
If you use the simplified editor (hsed3le.exe), you can use the standard HSP functions.
It can also be run on Windows 95 with Internet Explorer 4.0 or later installed, but it is not covered by the warranty.

On Windows other than the Japanese version, garbled characters may occur in the standard "HSP script editor".
In that case, you can select the corresponding tool from the <a href="https://hsp.tv/make/downlist.html" target="_blank"> HSPTV! Site Download List </a>. I will.
		</pre>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>
You need a display with a resolution of 640 x 480 or higher and a display capable of displaying 256 colors or higher.
The amount of memory required varies depending on the size of the image to be displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
HSP works by itself. No additional DLLs or runtimes need to be installed for standard functionality.
		<br>
		</p>

<h2 id = "PACKAGE"> Package configuration </h2>
		<p>
The HSP3.6 full set is based on the OpenHSP technology released as open source.
It is configured so that you can easily enjoy programming on Windows.
Starting with "HSP Script Editor" for writing scripts
Tool "Peas" that allows you to visually check the operation of the program,
Equipped with "HSP TV browser" that allows you to enjoy user-created content,
It is an integrated development environment that can be widely used in all situations from beginners to advanced users.
		</p>

<h2 id = "ATFIRST"> First time use </h2>
		<p>
If you are new to HSP3, please read and start using the <a href="hspprog.htm"> programming manual </a> after installing the full package.
Explains the basic mechanism and usage of HSP3. If you are new to programming, please also see <a href="beginner/START.HTM"> Introduction to HSP </a>. <br>
If you are already using a previous version, <a href="update36.htm"> HSP3.6 New Feature Highlights </a> or <a href="update.htm"> HSP3 Update Guide </a> > Will be helpful.
		</p>

<h2 id = "INSTALL"> Install </h2>
		<p>
The full set of HSP3.6 is available in a version with an installer and a compressed file version.
Launch the installer or unzip the hsp36 folder to any directory
You will be able to use it. (The recommended directory is "c: \\ hsp36")
		</p>
		<p>
If HSP3.6 or earlier is already installed, uninstall the previous one
We recommend that you then install the new version.
However, the HSP3.6 installer does not add files other than the installation folder, so
It does not conflict with previous versions. (It is also possible to use it at the same time as the past version.)
		</p>
		<p>
On Windows 2000 or later (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, etc.), write permission is required for the HSP3.6 installation folder.
Even if you install in the default directory of the installer (/ HSP35)
Make sure to run it as a user with administrator privileges.
		</p>
		<p>
If you are using Windows Vista or later, you can use the User Account Control (UAC) function.
Administrator privileges may be required during installation.
In this case, please continue the process with administrator privileges.
		</p>

<h2 id = "UNINSTALL"> Uninstall </h2>
		<p>
If you have installed HSP with the installer, you can remove the program with the attached uninstaller.
If you installed it manually, you can uninstall it by deleting all the folders.
		</p>
		<p>
If HSP is installed under Program Files on Windows Vista or later OS
Additional data from the HSPTV browser and document viewer may be left in the virtual store.
By deleting the following data together, you can uninstall including additional files.
			<pre>
C: \\ Users \\ (user name) \\ AppData \\ Roaming \\ Hot Soup Processor
HSP installation folder under C: \\ Users \\ (user name) \\ AppData \\ Local \\ VirtualStore </pre>
		</p>
		<p>

The standard script editor stores the settings in the following registry by default. If necessary, please delete it here as well.
			<pre>
		HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OnionSoftware\hsed3_3
